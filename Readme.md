WiFi Networks and Passwords
==================================================
Export Date: 01/17/2026 10:30:45
==================================================

Network Name: HomeNetwork
Password: mypassword123
--------------------------------------------------

Network Name: OfficeWiFi

--------------------------------------------------

Network Name: Cafe_Guest
Password: (No password / Open network)
--------------------------------------------------

==================================================

==================================================
```

## How It Works

The script uses Windows built-in `netsh` commands to:
1. List all saved WiFi profiles on your system
2. Retrieve the password for each profile
3. Format and export the data to a text file

## Security Notes

🔐 **Keep your output file secure!**

- The exported file contains your WiFi passwords in plain text
- Store it in a secure location
- Delete it after use if you only needed temporary access
- Do not share the file publicly

## Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" Error
- **Solution:** Make sure you're running the script as administrator

### "Directory does not exist" Error
- **Solution:** The script will attempt to create the directory automatically. If it fails, check that you have write permissions for the specified path.

### No Passwords Found
- **Solution:** You'll only see passwords for networks you've previously connected to on this computer. The passwords must be stored in Windows.

### Script Not Working on Windows 10
- **Solution:** The script works on both Windows 10 and 11, but make sure you have the latest updates installed. More specifically check if netsh is installed and working.

## Command Reference

The script uses these Windows commands internally:
```batch
netsh wlan show profiles              # Lists all WiFi profiles
netsh wlan show profile name="NAME" key=clear  # Shows password for specific profile
```

## FAQ

**Q: Will this work on Windows 7 or 8?**  
A: It should work on Windows 7 and later, though it's primarily tested on Windows 10/11.

**Q: Can I export passwords from someone else's computer?**  
A: You can only export passwords that are saved on the computer you're running the script on. You need administrator access to that computer.

**Q: Why do I need administrator privileges?**  
A: Windows stores WiFi passwords in a protected area that requires elevated permissions to access, for security reasons.

**Q: Can this hack WiFi passwords?**  
A: No. This only retrieves passwords that are already saved on your computer. It cannot crack or hack passwords for networks you haven't connected to.

**Q: Is my data sent anywhere?**  

A: No. This script runs entirely locally on your computer. No data is sent to any server or external location.
